The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), also known by its original name Rijndael

 AES is a symmetric block cipher chosen by the U.S. government to protect classified information to encrypt sensitive data.


It is based on `substitutionâ€“permutation network`


AES performs all its computations on bytes rather than bits and 

processes the 128 bits of a plaintext block as 16 bytes arranged in 4x4 matrix
