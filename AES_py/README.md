### **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)** ==  **_Rijndael_**

 1. AES is a symmetric block cipher chosen by the U.S. government to protect classified information to encrypt sensitive data.


2. It is based on `substitutionâ€“permutation network`


3. AES performs its computations on bytes and 

arranges the 128 bits of a plaintext block as 16 bytes in 4x4 matrix
